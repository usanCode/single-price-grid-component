## Welcome!

For this project, I have just created a main grid-container by 
setting the display property with the value "grid".
The grid contains just two columns and four rows for the desktop version
while for the mobile one , I have set 1 column and five rows.
For the main text , in the heading and i just made that the content was displayed 
on both columns for the Desktop version.
