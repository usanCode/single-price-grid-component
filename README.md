## Welcome!

- [Overview](#overview)

This challenge is about building a webpage for advertizing a business's services.

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)

The design of the webpage seems to be simple but there are some tricks and we should pay attention
on how it should be displayed on various devices. Definitively, the display propety value for this webpage 
is "grid".

- [My process](#my-process)

For this project, I have just create a main grid-container by 
setting the display property with the value "grid".
The grid contains just two columns and four rows for the desktop version
while for the mobile one , I have set 1 column and five rows.
For the main text , in the heading and i just made that the content was displayed 
on both columns for the Desktop version.

HTML and CSS
  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

With this challenge, I have learned that we should be very careful about setting the size of items 
because the sizes of these latter can expand or get dramatically reduced when viewing the webpage 
on other devices. For instance, I noticed the width of the button really changed that according to the 
device in which the webpage is displayed and, I tought of using other mesure units like %,rem . I have 
tought of using vh units but I did not noticed much change.
